# MNIST-Convolutional-Neural-Network
This project is a basic convolutional neural network created using tensorflow. It uses tensorflow's MNIST data set to train and validate a model to be used to categorize hand drawn images from Microsoft Paint.
The steps towards creating this project were followed from "DeepLearning_by_PhDScholar" on YouTube.
